The Forest Change Analysis Lab (FOCAL) at the [University of California Davis](http://www.ucdavis.edu) works at the intersection of disturbance ecology and data science. We collect and analyze data to inform forest management in an era of climate change, drought, and large high-severity wildfires. We rely as much on large geospatial datasets as on field-based measurements of forests. We work closely with forest managers in an effort to address pressing forest management needs.
