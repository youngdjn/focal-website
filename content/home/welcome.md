<p>The FOCAL Lab works at the intersection of forest disturbance ecology and data science. We collect and analyze data to inform forest management in an era of climate change, drought, and large high-severity wildfires. We rely as much on large geospatial datasets as on field-based measurements of forests. We work closely with forest managers in an effort to address pressing forest management needs.</p>
