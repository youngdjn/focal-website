## Overview

These positions are a part of the [Open Forest Observatory](http://www.openforestobservatory.org) project, hosted by the FOCAL Lab at UC Davis.

This is a 9-month paid traineeship position for current UC Davis undergraduate students with an expected graduation date of fall 2023 or later. The position includes training and computer-based research experience during the school year (approx. 3-8 hours/week) and full-time fieldwork during summer 2023. The position begins in early spring quarter 2023, continues through summer 2023, and ends in late fall quarter 2023. There are two positions available.

The trainees will learn skills in using drones for forest ecology research, including field-based skills (drone piloting, ground-based field validation data collection) and computer-based skills (drone imagery processing and analysis). The trainees will interact and work with Open Forest Observatory scientists.

In spring quarter 2023, the trainees will spend most of their traineeship time (approx. 3-5 hours/week) studying for and taking the exam to receive their FAA Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate via a standalone online course and mentorship provided by FOCAL Lab PI Derek Young. They will spend a small amount of time assisting in drone data processing and/or field planning tasks under the mentorship of FOCAL Lab members.

In summer quarter 2023, the trainees will work almost entirely in the field (trips of ~8 days at a time, returning to Davis between each). They will serve as the assistants to two professional drone pilots. Work will involve walking off-trail through the forest to assist with the drone operation as a visual observer. The trainee will also spend some time as the primary pilot under the supervision of the professional drone pilot. The final month of the field season will involve traditional plot surveys to collect ground-based reference data (vegetation inventories) to support drone imagery analyses. Field conditions can be harsh, and trainees must have prior outdoor experience demonstrating their ability to work in these conditions.

In fall quarter 2023, the trainees will work in the FOCAL lab for 3-8 hours/week to assist in processing the drone-based and plot-based field data that was collected over the summer and begin initial analyses. Training and mentorship will be provided.

## **Compensation**

$15.50/hr. Training and FAA exam study time are paid hours. Internship credit can also be arranged.

## Dates

Fall 2023, summer 2023, spring 2023 (all three terms). Part-time work during the school year and full-time work during the summer.

## **Location**

- During the summer: remote forested field sites in the Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade mountains of California, with potential for occasional out-of-state trips (Duty station: UC Davis, Davis, CA)
- During the school year: office/computer space in the FOCAL Lab at UC Davis (with a remote component permitted)

## **Summer work logistics**

The two professional drone pilots and two trainees will form two teams of two and swap occasionally. The two teams will be able to coordinate schedules to work at nearby sites and will likely camp together each night. Due to the remoteness of the field sites, the trainees should expect to spend up to 8 consecutive days in the field (see *Work schedule*, below) with frequent relocations of camp (included in work hours) during each hitch.

### Field conditions

Field conditions will often be hot with little shade, but can also be very cold and potentially wet. The work will involve extensive camping, usually with no facilities like bathrooms or running water. The trainees must have prior outdoor experience demonstrating their ability to work in the sometimes harsh field conditions. If you don't have this experience, please see the section "What if I don't have enough outdoor experience?" below.

### Field gear

All necessary field equipment will be provided. Communal camping gear (e.g., water jugs and cooking gear) will also be provided. Camping gear (basic tent, sleeping bag, and sleeping pad) will be provided. The trainees will be responsible for their own field clothing.

### Camping

While conducting fieldwork, the trainees will primarily be car camping near the project study sites on National Forests. Camping will usually be “dispersed camping” (undeveloped areas with no facilities, adjacent to remote roads) but will occasionally be in campsites (with campsite fees paid by employer). Camping location will change frequently as the team moves to different study areas.

### Summer fieldwork schedule

The default summer work schedule will generally consist of 8 consecutive 10-hour days followed by 6 days off (80 work hours every 2 weeks), beginning and ending on Wednesdays. The 8-day hitches may include 1-2 days of office work, usually the last of the 8 days, to document the previous field period and prepare for the next. Field campaigns will begin and end at the duty station in Davis, CA. Travel between Davis and the field sites, and between field sites, is included in work hours. Although active flying periods will not exceed 6 hours per day, the remaining hours are spent scouting the next day’s flight location, moving camp (if necessary), and charging/maintaining equipment. In some cases, it may be logistically most practical for the first and last days of a hitch to be half-days, spreading the 8 days (80 hours) of work over 9 days. The drone pilots will arrange and coordinate schedules with the trainees and the position supervisor to achieve the greatest efficiency.

During fire season, smoke and fire hazards may necessitate rapid adjustments to work location or schedule (e.g., shifting departure and/or return dates to avoid hazardous fire weather conditions). In the event of extended periods of fire or smoke hazards, the position supervisor will work to identify alternative work locations that avoid hazards, but during peak fire season, continuous full-time employment cannot be guaranteed.

### Field transportation

The trainees will be expected to share in driving a UC Davis fleet vehicle to the field sites.

## What if I don't have enough outdoor experience?

Outdoor experience is required so that we know you are comfortable in the types of conditions you will encounter in this position. We will offer a similar position next year, so we encourage you to get some outdoor experience and then check back next year. Outdoor experience does not need to be from a job! We encourage you to go on some camping or backpacking trips with UCD Outdoor Adventures. Especially valuable is "dispersed camping" without facilities like bathrooms or running water, where you have to bring everything you'll need, as those are the sorts of conditions we work in. We can also arrange an opportunity for you to come out to the field for 2-3 days during summer 2023 to observe the fieldwork and get a feel for the field conditions. If you are interested in this opportunity, please email FOCAL Lab PI Derek Young (djyoung@ucdavis.edu).

## Minimum qualifications

*Note: The minimum qualifications for this position will be adhered to strictly. If you do not meet the minimum qualifications, we are unfortunately unable to consider you for this position. We will offer a similar position next year, so we encourage you to build your qualifications and check back next year.*

- UCD undergraduate student in ecology, natural resource management, or related field
- Coursework or practical experience in working with quantitative geospatial data, such as a GIS class
- Experience hiking and camping in remote locations with no facilities
- Ability to maintain a positive attitude in physically harsh and/or demanding conditions
- Strong quantitative and organizational skills
- Valid driver’s license and willingness to drive to and between remote field sites
- CPR and Wilderness First Aid certified (certification may be accomplished after job offer is made, with registration cost paid by the employer)

## Desired qualifications

- Skilled navigating on- and off-trail using topographic maps, compass, and handheld GPS units
- Excellent organizational skills for planning, data management, and equipment management
