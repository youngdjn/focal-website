*Position in the FOCAL Lab at UC Davis in collaboration with USGS*

</div>

&nbsp;

**Position summary:** Dr. Derek Young (UC Davis FOCAL Lab) and Dr. Phil van Mantgem (USGS Western Ecological Research Center) are recruiting a postdoc with strong data science skills for a project focused on analysis of **high-resolution imagery** (drone, airplane, and satellite) and **plot-based field data** to understand post-fire forest dynamics in areas of recent large wildfires in California. Strong background in scripted (e.g., R-based) geospatial processing and statistical/machine learning analysis of large datasets is required. Optional opportunities exist to incorporate lidar data and computer vision into analyses. The position will integrate with the [Open Forest Observatory](https://openforestobservatory.org/) and other efforts in the FOCAL Lab, including a study of [early post-fire regeneration](https://changingforests.com/current-research/early-regen/).

**Project overview**

Wildfires in western U.S. dry forests are increasingly burning large areas at high severity. In large contiguous severely burned patches, near-complete overstory mortality challenges natural forest regeneration processes, which require nearby surviving trees to serve as seed sources. Evaluating burn severity patterns – and thus regeneration potential – across large wildfires generally relies on satellite imagery due to its ready availability and spatially continuous coverage. However, the imagery datasets traditionally used have relatively coarse pixels (e.g., ~ 30 m Landsat), which can contain multiple trees and may miss small patches of surviving trees (“fire refugia”) that have critical value as seed sources for regeneration. Relatedly, trees that initially survive the fire – but that sustained injuries – may ultimately die in the following years, with implications for their value as seed sources. The presence of drought before and/or after fire may affect the prevalence of fire refugia and delayed mortality.

This project will use traditional Landsat imagery along with newer and alternative higher-resolution imagery sources, including Sentinel-2, WorldView-3, NAIP, and drone imagery collected by PI Young, to understand the prevalence and spectral signatures of small fire refugia and delayed mortality. The work, which will focus on recent large wildfires in the western US, will take advantage of existing ground-reference plot data capturing post-fire canopy conditions. In addition to addressing ecological questions related to fire mortality and seed source availability, the work will help refine best practices in use of Landsat vs. alternative imagery data sources for fire severity characterization. Related empirical post-fire recovery work in the 2020 and 2021 study fires is already underway in the FOCAL Lab, and there are substantial opportunities for collaboration and co-authorship across related projects. This work is part of a larger USGS-led project to describe the effects of recent large wildfires in the western US on water, cultural resources, and landslide hazards. The postdoc will be supervised by Derek Young (UC Davis) and work in close collaboration with Phil van Mantgem (USGS), Andrew Latimer (UC Davis), and other members of the larger USGS project. The position will be based at UC Davis.

**Primary postdoc duties**
- Adapt/refine the analytical approach developed by the PIs, with potential to incorporate additional questions of interest to the postdoc
- Assist with drone imagery processing (with training provided by Dr. Young)
- Lead the data analysis (including geospatial data assembly, processing, and statistical/machine learning analysis)
- Lead the preparation of a manuscript(s), including data releases
- Present the results at academic and/or land management conference(s) or similar events such as a California Fire Science Consortium webinar
- Contribute to the broader USGS collaborative project and related research in the FOCAL Lab, with opportunities for co-authorship

**Hours, dates, and work location:** The postdoc position is full time beginning in late 2022. The primary work location is a lab/office setting on the UC Davis campus, but some work can be performed remotely if desired. Funding is available for a minimum of one year, with potential extension for an additional six months or more.

**Compensation:** Salary is based on years of experience as a postdoc and ranges from $54,540 to $65,292 annually, with some flexibility to recognize highly relevant skills and experience. The salary table can be found [here](https://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/_files/2022/may-2022-postdoc-scales/t23.pdf). The postdoc will be eligible for full benefits.

**Minimum qualifications:**
- PhD in ecology, remote sensing, or related field
- Understanding of and interest in forest ecology and disturbance ecology concepts
- Proficiency with data processing and statistical modeling in R
- Proficiency with scripted geospatial analysis in R (e.g., using the ‘terra’, and ‘sf’ packages)
- Experience working with very large empirical (tabular) and imagery datasets
- Experience collaborating via GitHub or equivalent
- Experience mentoring diverse undergraduate and/or graduate students
- Evidence of ability to publish research results in peer-reviewed journals

**Desired qualifications:**
- Experience studying conifer forests in California or the western U.S.
- Experience with fire ecology research
- Experience with machine learning and other advanced data science methods

**To apply:** Please combine a cover letter, CV, and contact information for three references into a single PDF and email to Drs. Derek Young, djyoung@ucdavis.edu, and Phil van Mantgem,
pvanmantgem@usgs.gov. Use the exact subject line “Fire ecology postdoc” (without quotes). For fullest consideration, apply by Tues, November 1, 2022.
