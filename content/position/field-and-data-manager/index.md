*Position in the FOCAL Lab and [Latimer Lab](https://latimer.ucdavis.edu/), UC Davis*

</div>

<br>

**Employment period:** January (or February) - September 2023, with strong possibility of extension if desired

**Duty station:** Davis, California (UC Davis campus)

**Work location:** Office (65-80%) and field (20-35%). Up to half of office work may optionally be performed remotely. A desktop computer is available if desired.

**Time commitment:** 100%

**Compensation:** Approx. $24-28/hour or $54,000-$58,000/year (to be set by HR)

For candidates with a Ph.D., this position may be converted into a postdoc position, with commensurate compensation and additional opportunities for publication. However, the minimum requirement is a bachelorâ€™s degree.

**Purpose:** Coordinate the collection, management, and initial analysis of field-based and drone-based forest vegetation data to support forest ecology research projects

**Position summary:** This position will manage/co-manage several field crews and drone pilots collecting data from California mixed-conifer forests, including burned and unburned sites. The position will help to recruit and train field crew members; prioritize data collection sites (based on GIS analysis and field scouting) and direct crews to sites; ensure high standards in data collection, data management, and field safety; and organize collected field data. The position will also assist in compiling and pre-processing datasets in preparation for statistical analysis and may assist with some statistical analysis. The position will also include processing, quality control, and analysis of drone and other aerial imagery using automated workflows. The position will support the following studies: assessment of early (1-2 years) post-fire forest regeneration patterns, assessment of longer-term (~20 years) post-fire forest regeneration, collection and processing of drone imagery from burned and unburned forests for the [Open Forest Observatory](http://openforestobservatory.org), and assessment of large tree densities in unburned Sierra Nevada forests.

**Primary duties:**
- Coordinate field data collection
  - Examine existing data and use GIS to plan survey plot locations and prepare crew maps (in collaboration with PI)
  - When necessary, independently perform field reconnaissance to confirm selected survey locations are suitable (not each plot, but in general, e.g. to confirm appropriate forest type and accessibility) prior to crew visit
  - Interview and select field crew members (approx. 3 students and 3 graduates)
  - Test and revise field survey methods (in collaboration with PI)
  - Train crew members (in collaboration with PI)
  - Perform crew data quality control periodically throughout season as necessary
  - Manage crew schedules
  - When necessary, communicate with local forest contacts for access permission
  - Organize and prepare crew gear; purchase necessary field supplies
  - Serve as emergency contact for crews
  - Arrange WFA training for crews through UC Davis safety services
  - Coordinate UC Davis fleet vehicles
  - Coordinate data entry
- Manage datasets and prepare them for analysis
  - Clean field data (e.g., identify outliers, duplicated or missing plot IDs)
  - Organize and assign plot IDs to collected photos (optionally using a scripted analysis)
  - Compile multiple vegetation plot datasets from PI and collaborators into a standardized format; communicate with collaborators for clarification on data parameters if necessary
  - Perform geospatial interpretation of aerial (including drone-derived) imagery to support validation of automated analysis methods (e.g., delineate vegetation types, record tree presence/absence in images)
  - Inspect drone-derived imagery and use automated tools to process imagery into downstream products. Perform preliminary analysis of downstream products (e.g., compare drone-derived elevation to USGS DEM elevation).
- General research and lab assistance (as time allows)
  - Analyze forest vegetation plot data to address research questions (with option to contribute to paper authorship)
  - Search for journal articles relevant to post-fire forest recovery, and extract values to support a meta-analysis (with option to contribute to paper authorship).
  - Assist other lab members with field and lab work

**Minimum qualifications:**
- Experience working on and leading forest ecology field crews
- Experience organizing ecological datasets
- Experience using GIS software for plot layout or other geospatial analysis
- Experience writing R and/or Python code for data processing and analysis
- Willingness to work both independently and collaboratively in the office and field
- Comfort with dispersed camping in remote locations without facilities
- Willingness to drive University or personal vehicle on remote forest roads independently to perform plot reconnaissance, meet crew, and check data quality
- Strong interpersonal skills for crew management
- Experience working successfully with individuals from diverse backgrounds

**Desired qualifications:**
- Experience collecting and processing drone imagery
- Experience managing and organizing data in cloud storage such as Google Drive or Box
- Experience collaborating on code development using a platform such as GitHub

**To apply:** Please combine a cover letter, CV, and contact information for three references into a single PDF and email to Dr. Derek Young, djyoung@ucdavis.edu. Use the exact subject line "Field and data manager" (without quotes). For fullest consideration, apply by Friday, November 4, 2022.
