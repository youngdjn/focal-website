Nina's work focuses on post-fire forest dynamics, particularly conifer seed production following fire and the influence of fire injury on seed production. Her research seeks to address whether surviving trees in moderate- and high-severity burn areas may be less effective seed sources for forest recovery then their uninjured counterparts outside the fire perimeter. Nina is also interested in the ecological and sociological context of forest management.
