Mï»¿y current research focuses on Facilitation; how do neighboring perennial plants affect the ecology, the population genetic structure, and the adaptive phenotypic plasticity of the annual grass *Brachypodium hybridum* in southern Spain. My research interests also include restoration ecology, such as the effects of fire on invasive and federally endangered species.
